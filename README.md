## App Description (what it does) 
This app will try to connect students to others who have experienced the stress of school and form a connection and an outlet. These mentors would preferably be from the industry and in the same field as the student.
## App Design (how will it work) 
* The student would create a profile with their general information (location and stuff) and what they're studying.
* Our app would take the information and give the student a match with a mentor. This mentor will be willing to listen to the student and give advice.
## Users (who it is designed for)
Currently this app is designed for college students and industry mentors.
## Impact (how it is going to help society)
