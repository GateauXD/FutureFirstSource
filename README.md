## App Description (what it does); 
This app will try to connect students to others who have exepreinced the stress of school and form a connection and an outlet. These "mentors" would perferablly be from the industry and in the same field as the student.  
## App Design (how will it work); 
* The student would create a profile with their genral information (location and stuff) and what they're studying. 
* Our app would take the information and give the student a match with a mentor. This mentor will be willing to listen to the student and give advice.
## Users (who it is designed for); 
* Currently this app is designed for college students. 
## Impact (how it is going to help society)
