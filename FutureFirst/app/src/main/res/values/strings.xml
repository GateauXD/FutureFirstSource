    <string name="Bio">
        After college I was looking to work in a fast-paced environment where I could tangibly contribute to the outcome of a company. Plaid sells a fascinating product and is a ground-breaking company in the fintech space in spite of its size– this means that every employee\'s work is really meaningful.
        I chose to work in sales because the skillset that it imparts is diverse and highly transferable, and the front-lines nature of it means that there's never a dull moment in my day-to-day.
